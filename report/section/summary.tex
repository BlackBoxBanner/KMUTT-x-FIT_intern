	\section{Summary}
	
	This report presents an in-depth analysis of a Random Forest Regressor model employed to forecast total sales. The key findings are as follows:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Notably, the model exhibits exceptional accuracy, with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 1.157407407e-16, indicating that it effectively captures the patterns and relationships within the training data.
		\item However, the simulated impact of three strategic interventions (reducing food loss, increasing effort in lunch, and enhancing customer frequency) yielded minimal increases in total sales, with each strategy resulting in a predicted increase of approximately 0.045 units.
		\item The original total sales value is substantial at 101,800,509.5, which may overshadow the impact of small percentage changes in the simulated strategies.
	\end{itemize}
	
	In conclusion, while the model demonstrates high accuracy, the simulated strategies do not appear to have a significant influence on total sales. To derive more meaningful insights and improvements, further investigation into refining simulation parameters, enhancing feature engineering, experimenting with different models, and improving data quality is recommended.
